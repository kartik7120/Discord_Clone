# Discord_Clone

A (Minimum Viable Product) chat app using Discord app UI

## Features

- The messages will be visible to all the Users that are in the chat app (using WebSockets)
- When a new User joins the chat, a message is displayed to all the existing Users
- Messages are saved in a database
- User can send images, videos and links which will be displayed properly
- User can select and send an emoji
- Users can chat in private
- Users can join channels on specific topics

I got the idea for this app from this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Chat-App.md)

Here is the url for the app : [Chat App](https://discord-clone-virid.vercel.app/)
